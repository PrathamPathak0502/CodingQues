Overview
This document provides detailed information on how to use the machine learning model, including setup instructions, how to load and use the model, and troubleshooting common issues.

Model Details
Model Type: Keras/TensorFlow
File Format: .h5
Model Path: /content/model/my_model.h5
Description: This model is trained to [brief description of what the model does, e.g., classify images, predict numerical values, etc.].
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Before using the model, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow (version 2.x or later)
Other dependencies (if any, e.g., numpy, pandas, PIL)
File Placement
Download or Transfer the Model File:

Ensure the model file is saved as my_model.h5 and is placed in the directory /content/model/.
Verify the File Path:

Check that the file exists at the specified path. The full path should be /content/model/my_model.h5.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
FileNotFoundError:

Cause: The file does not exist at the specified path.
Solution: Verify the file path and ensure the model file is in the correct location.
Permission Denied:

Cause: Lack of permissions to access the file.
Solution: Check file permissions and ensure your script or environment has read access to the file.
Model Load Errors:

Cause: The model file might be corrupted or not in the expected format.
Solution: Verify the model file is correctly saved and not corrupted. Ensure it is in .h5 format.
